RTVBE History
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 v3.0 Final version.
       * Completly rewritten. More robust, more simplier, more easier to implements.
       * HTML documentation.
       * Removed uvbelib (you don't need it anymore).
       * Added structure informations for VBE 3.0

 v2.13 Maintenance version.
       * Page flip test example
       * Some functions name has changed
       * More comments.
       * Tested with Watcom 11

 v2.11 Major update ( DJGPP )
       When looking for a 16bit, you must know that the VESA driver may returns
       a 15bit instead: This is fixed (another Matrox bug (even Direct Draw
       is fooled :))
       Added PM Management function.

 v2.10 Christmas Release.
       Bug fixed version.
       New initialization.
       Directories and .Lib.
       GIFT! : With Uvbelib (no need to install univbe 5.2 in memory)
       Include Uvbelib.lib 5.2  : copy you univbe.drv in this path for using
       the build in univbe :)
 
 v2.02 Optimized Julia rendering + timer (4230 ms on 486DX4/120-Tseng4000W32)
 
 v2.01 Fixed the scanline function. Set the right scanline length
       (on Matrox Millenium 800x600x8 has a 960 pixel scanline length 
        instead of 800 !. So it fix it)

 v2.00 - Compatibility with DJGPP v2.00 (*nearly* all DPMI functions has been
       rewritten)
       - Clearer code
       New email : stedenis@worldnet.fr

       *** No more base selector ***
       
       You can write and read without specificing remapped selector.
       Use the address given in VESA.Map

       It improves speed on Pentium (1 cycle was previously lost 
       for 16bit overriding), And code size (1 byte :)

 v1.05 Fixed some bugs in initialization mode. You should use DOS4GW v1.95
       at least (some DPMI functions doesn't exists above)
 
 v1.00 First version
